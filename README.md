# 🦁 Escape the Lion Game

## Introduction

**Escape the Lion** is a thrilling side-scrolling running game where you must help a poacher escape a fast-approaching lion and reach the jeep to survive. 

During the chase:
- 🍖 Eat food to gain **temporary speed boosts**
- 🌿 Avoid bushes — hitting them causes the **lion to gain speed**

Can you make it to the jeep before getting caught?
